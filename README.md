# Growth Funnel & Retention Analysis

**E-commerce Product Analytics Case Study**

## Project Overview

This project analyzes user behavior in a large-scale e-commerce environment to understand how product engagement translates into revenue and long-term value.

The main goal is to identify where users drop off in the conversion funnel, how purchasing behavior evolves over time, and which segments truly drive business impact.

## Business Context

The dataset contains event-level user interactions from a multi-category e-commerce platform, including product views, cart additions, and purchases across two months (October and November 2019).

From a business perspective, this analysis answers questions like:

- Is user engagement improving over time?
- Are increases in activity translating into real revenue?
- Which product segments drive growth versus just traffic?
- Are new customers returning and generating long-term value?

This mirrors real scenarios where growth teams need to balance acquisition scale with sustainable customer value.

## Key Questions This Analysis Answers

- How efficient is the view -> cart -> purchase funnel?
- Did conversion performance improve month over month?
- Which price segments generate revenue versus just engagement?
- Which product categories are driving growth?
- How does customer retention behave over time?
- What is the observed lifetime value (LTV) of different cohorts?

## Dataset and Tooling

**Dataset**

- Public Kaggle dataset: *E-commerce Behavior Data from Multi-Category Store*
- Around 110 million raw event records

**Technology stack**

- Python
- DuckDB (large-scale analytical processing)
- Pandas
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (visualization)
- GitHub Pages (`docs/index.html`) for portfolio presentation

To keep processing fast and scalable, raw CSV files were converted into Parquet and queried with DuckDB.

## Data Modeling and Performance Decisions

- Conversion of raw CSV files to Parquet for efficient storage and querying
- DuckDB queries directly over Parquet files
- Enriched event views with:
  - `event_date`
  - `event_month`
  - `event_week`
- Separation of raw and processed data to keep the repository organized

These are practical data engineering choices aligned with day-to-day analytics work.

## Funnel Analysis

Core journey analyzed: **View -> Cart -> Purchase**

### Key Findings

- **View-to-cart conversion doubled** from October to November, indicating stronger purchase intent.
- **Cart-to-purchase conversion dropped**, suggesting checkout friction became more relevant as top-of-funnel activity expanded.
- **Overall view-to-purchase improved only slightly**, so funnel gains did not convert proportionally into final purchases.

## Revenue and Price Segment Insights

- **Revenue increased month over month**
- **High-priced products represent most of total revenue**
- Low-priced products add engagement but contribute little to total revenue

This indicates November growth was mainly premium-led rather than broad-based across all price tiers.

## Retention and Cohort Analysis

Retention was analyzed through weekly purchase cohorts.

### Key Findings

- **Strong early repeat behavior** in the first week
- **Sharp drop after week 2**
- **More recent cohorts start weaker**, which may indicate:
  - lower acquisition quality
  - lower short-term repeat intent
  - growth driven by broader traffic mix

These patterns point to opportunities in lifecycle marketing and post-purchase engagement.

## Observed LTV (Lifetime Value)

An observed LTV proxy was calculated from total revenue per user in each cohort.

Main pattern:

- Older cohorts show higher observed LTV (longer monetization window)
- Newer cohorts show lower early observed value

This reinforces the need to balance scale with customer quality.

## Portfolio Visuals (Current State)

- Visual assets are generated by `generate_portfolio_assets.py`
- Output files:
  - `assets/funnel.png`
  - `assets/retention.png`
  - `assets/revenue.png`
- The portfolio page is rendered through `docs/index.html`

## Next Steps

Possible extensions:

- Attribution modeling by traffic source
- Predictive LTV modeling
- Experimentation design (A/B test simulation)
- Integration with richer product usage signals

This project shows end-to-end product analytics thinking: from user behavior and conversion to retention and monetization, with a focus on clear business decisions.
